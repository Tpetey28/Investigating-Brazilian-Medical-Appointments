Project: Investigating Brazilian Medical Appointments
Introduction
In this report, I am investigating a dataset that includes information about ~100k medical appointments in Brazil. I will be looking to answer several important questions in this analysis.
The first: Which characteristics make a person more likely to miss their appointment?
This is an important question for the healthcare organization to understand to improve their efforts when comparing forecasted demand to actual demand. Ensuring that the organization is staffed appropriately is key in the business of healthcare as not having enough caregivers could be catastrophic to the care levels it can provide for it's patients. Whereas the salaries for healthcare professionals are expensive, and having too many caregivers could be very detrimental to the business in a financial aspect. Staffing as accurately as possible will be very important to maintaining the right level of care for patients while not overspending on caregiver compensation.
The second: Is our SMS reminder system effective and if so, is there a particular demographic of person that it is and is not effective for?
It is also important for the business to understand the impact of the sms reminder system. If it is not effective, the organization should explore ways to improve the reminder, or simply remove the sms reminder system and trim the costs associated with providing and supporting the process. It may be that the sms system is only impactful for certain age groups. Knowing this could help the organization limit their costs by only providing the service for select demographics.
